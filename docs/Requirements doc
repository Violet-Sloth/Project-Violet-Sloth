Requirements: A Requirements Document
=====================================


1. Overall goals
----------------

Our goal: Create a TLO Alexa skill. It will give the Word of the Day in a given language to the user, and potentially we will be adding additional abilities as well. 
 
Why: Initially we are starting this as a side project for fun, but it may expand beyond this in the future. 

Use cases: Users of Alexa-enabled devices can install this as a way to practice learning a language. Could be used in conjunction with our program as well. 

Perhaps more importantly, what are we choosing *not* to do?

What we are NOT doing: TBD


2. Background and technical assumptions
---------------------------------------

Platforms: Linux

Programming Language: Python

Services: AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3

4. User stories
---------------

User Story: Alexa Echo User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A user has installed the skill to aid with their learning. After Alexa discerns their preferred learning language, they ask Alexa for the word of the day and learn its meaning.


5. Questions
------------

none yet

6. Saying no
------------

-Don’t direct user to a webpage to view supported languages
-Don’t keep all data for all sound files in our database (expense will be prohibitive)
